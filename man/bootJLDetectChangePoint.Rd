\title{Bootstrap Change Point Detection with Johnson-Lindenstrauss dimension reduction}
\usage{
bootJLDetectChangePoint(
  multiSeries,
  reducedDim = 5,
  useGaussian = TRUE,
  setdetail,
  useBFIC = TRUE,
  numRepeat = 100,
  numKeep = 2,
  alpha = 0.05,
  useJL = TRUE,
  rotate_xaxis = FALSE,
  returnPlot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{multiSeries}{The high dimensional time series. Should be a matrix, with each row being an observation of the time series.}

\item{reducedDim}{The dimension you want to project onto. Should be less than the dimension of the time series. Default is 5}

\item{useGaussian}{Set to TRUE if you want to use a random Gaussian projection. Set to FALSE for random Bernoulli matrix.}

\item{setdetail}{Optional argument to set the detail level you wish to use. Default is all details.}

\item{useBFIC}{Optional argument to use BFIC to decide change point location.}

\item{numRepeat}{Number of times to repeat random projection. Default is 100.}

\item{numKeep}{The number of indices that are considered significant at each iteration.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level of the bootstrap.}

\item{useJL}{Use Johnson-Lindenstrauss dimension reduction. Not currently implemented for useJL = FALSE.}

\item{rotate_xaxis}{set to TRUE if you wish to rotate the values on the x-axis; will not print out all values}

\item{returnPlot}{set to TRUE if you wish for the plot to be returned.}
}
\value{
List with values
\item{prop}{The proportion of times the BFIC of the bootstrapped time series showed significance.}
\item{indices}{A table of indices that were in the numKeep most likely change points at least once, together with the number of times that they occured.}
\item{sigindices}{The indices which occured more often than would be indicated by chance.}
\item{q95}{Estimate for the cutoff of the number of times indices would have to appear to be included in sigindices.}
}
\description{
Bootstraps list of indices at which change point may have occured in a multi-dimensional time series with normal noise.
Samples the time component and interpolates between values when there are repeats. This function has not been thoroughly tested, and is not implemented in several key cases.
}
\examples{

multiseries <- createTimeSeries(mu1 = rep(0, 100), mu2 = rep(1,100))
bootJLDetectChangePoint(multiseries) #True change point is at t = 72
